# NS_data

Output files from the sequences.c code that computes a series of constant 
baryonic mass tracks of neutron stars with changing spin velocity. Each column in the file represents:

1. Central energy density
2. Total mass
3. Baryonic mass
4. Mass when the NS is not rotating 
5. Maximum mass of a non rotating NS for a given EOS (obtained from maxmass.c)
6. Radius 
7. Ratio r_p/r_e
8. Radius when the NS is not rotating
9. Spin frequency
10. Kepler limit
11. Angular momentum
12. Rotational kinetic energy
13. Gravitational binding energy
14. Maximum radius of the non rotating star for a given EOS (obtained from maxmass.c)
15. Ratio of the maximum mass and the maximum radius of the non rotating star
